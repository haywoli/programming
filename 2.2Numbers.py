# TASK 1. 
# print out the type of 10.3 + 5
print(type(10.3+5))

# TASK 2.
# print(a + b * c) # Correct this so that the ``+`` is evaluated first
# print(a**b+c)    # Correct this so that the exponent is b+c

# TASK 3. 
# print the output of a < b

# TASK 4. 
# print the output of (a < b) == (a <= b)
